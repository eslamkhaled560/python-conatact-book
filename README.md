This project is a contact book application that allows users to manage their contacts through a graphical user interface (GUI) built with PySimpleGUI. Users can perform various operations such as creating, saving, updating, deleting, listing, and searching contacts. Additionally, the application validates the email and phone number(s) for each contact.

## Features

__Daily CSV File Creation:__    
The application automatically creates a new CSV file for each day to store contact data. This ensures that the contact book remains organized and allows users to track changes over time.

__Save Contacts:__    
Users can add new contacts and save them to the current day's CSV file. The application prompts users to enter details such as name, email, phone number(s), and address.

__Update Contacts:__     
Users can update existing contacts by selecting them with the name and modifying their details. The updated information is then saved to the CSV file.

__Delete Contacts:__      
Users can delete unwanted contacts from the contact list. This operation removes the corresponding entry from the CSV file.

__List Contacts:__           
The application displays a list of all contacts from the current day's CSV file. Users can easily view their contacts and access their details.

__Search Contacts:__        
Users can search for specific contacts by providing the first name. The application scans the contact list and displays the matching contacts, allowing users to quickly find the desired information.

__Contact Validation:__         
The application validates email and phone number(s) for each contact to ensure they adhere to the specified formats. Users will be alerted if they enter invalid contact details.
